# Stock_Markdown

This project is a method of downloading company (financial) information and storing it in an structured data model. Preferably in an SQL like database. After that you can connect any type of visualization tool.

The model contains (at least) the following tables:
1. COMPANIES (permanent, functions as linktable)
2. STOCK_HISTORY

The data model can be used with any visualization tool (Tablau, Power BI, Qlik, etc.).
