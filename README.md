# Stock_Markdown

This project is a method of downloading company (financial) information and storing it in an structured data model. After that you can use any type of visualization tool to get your insights.

The model contains (at least) the following tables:
1. COMPANIES (permanent, functions as linktable)
2. STOCK_HISTORY
3. (To be expanded)

## Execute code

To execute the script, add your specific ticker to the __main__.py script, for example 'TSLA' Also toggle the modules that you require. After that you can run the script. If you use the STOCK module, you also need to specify a range for the stock history.
